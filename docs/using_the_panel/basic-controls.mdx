# BASIC NAVIGATIONS

## ACCESSING THE PANEL

![](./image-1753962014564.png)

You can access your server's main control panel [here](https://panel.atbphosting.com/). If you have multiple servers, you can choose which you want to modify from the panel page. Or, simply choose the server you want to control from the drop-down box of each page within the panel.

## HOME

This is likely your main dashboard or overview page for the server. It typically shows basic server status (online/offline), resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk), and perhaps quick access to server actions like starting, stopping, or restarting.

## CONSOLE

This is a crucial feature for server management. The terminal provides a command-line interface directly to your Minecraft server console. Here, you can:

*   See server logs (e.g., player joins/leaves, chat messages, errors).
*   Execute server commands (e.g., `/op <player>`, `/gamemode <player> creative`, `/save-all`, `/stop`).
*   Monitor server activity in real-time.

## FILES

![](./image-1753962041180.png)

This section allows you to manage the files and folders on your Minecraft server. You can:

*   Upload and download server files (e.g., world saves, plugin JARs, configuration files like `server.properties`).
*   Edit text files directly in the browser (e.g., plugin configurations, whitelist.json).
*   Create, delete, and rename files/folders.
*   Manage permissions for files if necessary.

## DATABASES

While not always required for a basic vanilla Minecraft server, many advanced setups and plugins (like economy plugins, some claim plugins, or BungeeCord/Velocity setups) utilize databases (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) to store persistent data. This section would allow you to:

*   Create and manage databases for your server.
*   Create database users and set permissions.
*   View database credentials for your server to connect to them.

## SCHEDULES

![](./image-1753962059772.png)

This feature is incredibly useful for automating server tasks. You can set up schedules to:

*   Automatically restart the server at specific intervals (e.g., daily at 3 AM for maintenance).
*   Run backup commands at set times.
*   Send warning messages to players before a scheduled restart.
*   Execute other server commands periodically.

## USERS

![](./image-1753962065365.png)

If you have multiple people managing your Minecraft server, this section allows you to:

*   Add new users to your Server panel.
*   Assign specific permissions to each user (e.g., allow someone to only view the console, or give another person full file management access).

## BACKUPS

![](./image-1753962075236.png)

This is essential for disaster recovery. The backups section allows you to:

*   Create manual backups of your entire server (including world, plugins, and configurations).
*   Download existing backups.
*   Restore your server from a previous backup in case of data corruption or accidental deletion.

## NETWORK ALLOCATION

![](./image-1753962083973.png)

This section typically deals with network settings for your server. For a Minecraft server, this might include:

*   Viewing the assigned IP address and port.
*   Managing additional ports if your server requires them for specific plugins or services (though less common for standard Minecraft).

## STARTUP

![](./image-1753962091869.png)

This is where you configure how your Minecraft server starts up. You can:

*   Select the Minecraft version or server JAR file to use.
*   Set Java arguments (e.g., memory allocation `-Xmx` and `-Xms`).
*   Configure specific startup parameters for your Minecraft server (e.g., `nogui`, `online-mode`).

## SETTINGS

![](./image-1753962101326.png)

This is a general settings area for your server instance. It might include:

*   Changing the server name displayed in the panel.
*   Reinstalling the server software (a clean slate).
*   Deleting the server.
*   Other general configuration options not covered by other specific sections.

## ACTIVITY

This log provides an audit trail of actions performed on your server through the Pterodactyl panel. You can see:

*   Who performed what action (e.g., server started, files uploaded, commands executed).
*   When the action occurred.
*   This is useful for troubleshooting and monitoring user activity.

**This navigation provides a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of a Minecraft server hosted on a ATBP HOSTING panel, from basic operations to advanced configurations and security.**
