# What are subusers?

Subusers are an access feature that allows you to authorize other people into being able to control your server with restricted permissions and features according to their rank without using your own account.

⚠ Only give access to the people you trust!

### Adding the subusers

1.  Go to the server that you'd like to share access to..
2.  Head on over to the **Users** section in the left side of your screen and going down to the 5th column! You should be able to find it there.
3.  Click on **New User** to start configuring access, enter their valid ATBP Hosting email and then select the permissions you'd like.
4.  Scroll to the very bottom of the users tab, where you'll see **Invite User**, click on that button and you should be good to go!

After doing all that, the email provided in the subusers should get an email sent to them notifying them that you have shared them access to your server!
