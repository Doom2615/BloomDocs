# Scheduling Actions

# What Are Schedules?
Schedules are ways to automate certain tasks through the Duck Panel such as starting/stopping/restarting the server, executing commands or even creating a backup.

# Creating A Schedule
First, go to your [Game Panel](https://panel.atbphosting.com/) and select Schedules on the navigation bar.

The main page will list all of our current schedules. To add a schedule, click the Create Schedule. Enter a name for your schedule and select when and how often you would like it to run.

Once created, click the schedule on the main list to view the tasks. Then, click New Task to add your first schedule action.

The final section is what will be sent as a command or as a power action. Commands should be used without the /. 

Here you can also specify a delay. This is useful if you would like to send a timed warning to your players before a restart for example.
