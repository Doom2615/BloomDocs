[ATBP Hosting](https://atbphosting.com/) allows you to split the server that you have with them, for example to run more Minecraft servers for different gamemodes or to run a Discord bot off of your server.

Splitting your server will take resources (Storage and RAM) from your main server. It's important to make sure that you leave enough resources so that your main server runs properly!

## **Split your server**

Firstly from the [game panel](https://panel.atbphosting.com/), navigate "More" and select the 'Splitter' option.

Click on Split Server and you will see a window confirming wether you want to continue with the server split.

You can interact and manage this new server in the same way as you would with your main server.

When you login to the game panel, you can see your new server in the list of servers you can manage.

The server list sorts servers by alphabetical order, you can rename your servers using numbers to arrange them. Here is an example: `1. Proxy` `2. Lobby`. You can rename servers in the settings tab.
