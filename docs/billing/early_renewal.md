## Early Renewals

Bloom.host clients can renew their services early, **as long as the next due date is less than 31 days away**. Please note that all Bloom.host services operate on a subscription basis. If you have a valid payment method linked to your Bloom.host Billing Account, your service will automatically renew on its due date.

---

### How It Works

You can renew your services early directly from our billing panel, specifically on the [Early Renewal](https://billing.bloom.host/service-renewals) page.

On this page, you can choose the service you want to renew early by clicking Add to Cart. If multiple services are eligible for early renewal, you can renew them all at once.

After adding the service to your cart, click Checkout and complete the checkout process. Once the process is complete, your service will be renewed.

### Renewal Eligibility

- You can only renew a service when the service’s **next due date is less than 31 days away**.  
- If your service is **more than 31 days away** from its due date, early renewal is **not available**.  
- Bloom.host staff **cannot manually renew** services outside of this 31-day window.

### Important Notes

- Early renewal **does not change or reset** your future billing due date.  
  For example, if your service renews on the 20th of each month and you renew early on the 10th, your **next renewal will still be on the 20th**.
- The system simply generates and allows you to pay your next invoice early — your normal renewal cycle remains unchanged.
